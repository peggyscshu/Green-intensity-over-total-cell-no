This is an automatic tool to quantify the green fluorescence signal over the total cell number from high content images.
### Goal
Sum up the green fluorescence signal and normailze it with the total cell number 
### Modality
The fluorescence light path of high content screen system EVOS
### Image
Nuclear channel and additional channel for intensity quantification
### Sample
Mammalian cells
